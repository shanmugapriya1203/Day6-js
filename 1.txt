a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.
class Movie{
      constructor(title,studio,rating){
          this.title = title;
          this.studio = studio;
          this.rating = rating;
      }
  }

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
class Movie{
      constructor(title,studio){
          this.title = title;
          this.studio = studio;
          this.rating = "PG";
      }
  }

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.
         class Movie{
      constructor(title,studio,rating){
          this.title = title;
          this.studio = studio;
          this.rating = rating;
      }
    getPG(arr){  
    arr=arr.filter((ele)=>ele.rating=="PG" || ele.rating=="PG13");
    return arr;
  }
  }  
  var F1 = new Movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG13");
  var F2 = new Movie("Vadachennai","Lyca Production Wunderbar films","A");
  var F3 = new Movie("Ponniyin Selvan","Madras Talkies Lyca Production");
  var film = new Movie();
  var arr = [F1,F2,F3];
  console.log(film.getPG(arr));

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
class Movie{
      constructor(title,studio,rating){
          this.title = title;
          this.studio = studio;
          this.rating = rating;
      }
      getPG(){
      return this.rating;
  }
  }  
  var film = new Movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG13");
  console.log(film.getPG());
